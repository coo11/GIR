# GIR - Reliable Image Host

- My first project used to learn Github RESTful API, Rollup.js and Bootstrap.
- CSS Generated by Template [twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-npm-starter). Put file `./src/scss/main.scss` into template's `./scss/` and rename it to `starter.scss`, then run `npm run build` to generate a CSS distribution `./assets/starter.css`.
